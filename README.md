# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


use " npm run dev " to run on localhost
live server is available on "https://sagararora198.github.io/Todo/"

This is a straightforward website designed for organizing your tasks using Vite. The application uses  context API and local storage, ensuring that the state persists even after refreshing the page or restarting the URL. Users can effortlessly add, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed, providing a seamless and persistent todo management experience.
